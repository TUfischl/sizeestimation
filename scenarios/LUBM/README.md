*Subfolder 100%*: Contains the 14 queries of the LUBM benchmark. Statistics are available for each base table.

*Subfolder 50%*: Contains the 14 queries of the LUBM benchmark. In this test scenario we want to realise cases where statistics are available only for a subset of the tables mentioned in the queries. We assume that tables prefixed by @ in the query body have no available statistics. 

*Subfolder schema*: Contains the table definitions (file schema.sql) and the schema dependencies as tuple-generating-dependencies (file dependencies.txt). Note that in the latter file, we assume prefix variables by �?�.

Instructions to install the schema and data for the IMDB test scenario in SQL Server and DB2

We got the LUBM ontology generator from http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/ and ran it with parameter 1K. We later borrowed a tool from Boris Motik to convert the data of the ontology in relational format and extract its dependencies.  

Instructions: 

1.Run the CREATE TABLE statements from schema.sql 

2.Get the data :) The data files were exceeding the maximum allowable github size. Send us email to get the raw �|�-delimited data.  

3.Load the data

*DB2* command: LOAD from 'path-file' of del modified by coldel| insert into <TABLE>;

*SQL Server* command:
 
BULK INSERT TABLE
FROM �path-to-file�
WITH
(
FIRSTROW = 1,
FIELDTERMINATOR = '|',      
ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',   
ERRORFILE = �path-to-log-file',
TABLOCK
)
